# SETUP

Instructions for an agent that sets up dsh-superagent with its operator. If you are a person, ask your coding agent to read this file and follow it.

## How to run the setup

The setup follows [docs/000-philosophy.md](docs/000-philosophy.md): it takes as little of the operator's attention as possible.

- **Before the first question,** read only this file and `docs/000-philosophy.md`, and run the probe below once. Read nothing else until every answer is collected.
- **Ask one question per message,** about one thing. Wait for the answer before the next one. Skip a question the probe already answers.
- **Keep each message under 300 words,** unless the operator asks for more. Give each question a recommended answer the operator can accept with one word, and one sentence on why it matters.
- **Do not execute while asking.** Collect every answer, then send one message with the full plan, and execute only after the operator confirms it.
- **Never ask for a secret in the chat.** Steps that need the operator's hands, such as creating an account, signing a CLI in or entering an app secret, go into one message with the exact commands to run in their own terminal.
- **Teach the philosophy through the questions,** one sentence at a time, not as a lecture.

## 1. Probe

Run from this checkout, once, and keep the result to yourself:

```sh
node -v; pnpm -v; git --version; tmux -V; python3 --version; gh --version | head -1; dsh --version
command -v gh tmux dsh
gh api user --jq .login
command -v lark-cli
grep -l -E 'id: dsh-superagent\b' "${DSH_HOME:-$HOME/.dsh}"/profiles/*/cordis.patch.yml 2>/dev/null
```

- **Prerequisites:** Node.js 22.19+ or 24+, pnpm, git 2.32+, tmux, Python 3.8+, GitHub CLI 2.48+, and DSH within the `engines.dsh` range of `package.json`. The `gh`, `tmux` and `dsh` commands must also be on the `PATH` the service starts with: `scripts/dsh-superagent start` runs `dsh` in a `tmux` session and the GitHub Source shells out to `gh`, so a tool that is installed but not on `PATH` fails at start. A missing `tmux` is the most common cause of a start failure. A missing prerequisite becomes an item of the plan, not a question. DSH also needs a model provider; if the operator has never run DSH with a model, configuring one is an operator step.
- **Agent GitHub token:** the token the agent's `gh` uses must have the `repo` and `notifications` scopes. Without `notifications`, the Source's poll of the agent account's notifications keeps answering 403 and no request arrives; without `repo`, setup cannot see push access and the agent cannot push. Request both when signing the wrapper in, with `gh-agent auth login -s repo,notifications`, or add a missing scope later with `gh-agent auth refresh -h github.com -s notifications`. `gh-agent auth status` prints the token's scopes.
- **Two different accounts:** the agent account and the account that sends the requests, usually the operator's, must be different GitHub accounts. GitHub does not notify an account of a mention written by that same account, so if the agent acts as the requester, the Source never sees the request. A dedicated agent account also keeps its comments and commits identifiable, which is why question 3 recommends one.
- **Operator login:** the `gh api user` result is the operator's own GitHub login, used as the recommendation in question 5.
- **Existing profile:** a profile with a `dsh-superagent` entry is an earlier setup: ask whether to continue it, keep its configuration, and read Upgrade in `docs/006-deployment.md`.

## 2. Questions

Ask in this order, one per message, following the flow of work in [docs/001-domain.md](docs/001-domain.md): first where Triggers come from, then who may ask for work there, then what the Executor does with a Ticket. Recommendations are in brackets.

**Sources: where requests come from.**

1. **Sources.** Should the agent take requests from GitHub only, or also from Feishu chats? [GitHub only, unless the team works in Feishu.]
2. **Repository.** Which github.com repository should the agent work on, as `owner/name`?
3. **Agent account.** Which GitHub user account will the agent act as? [A dedicated account, never the operator's own: everything the agent writes appears under this name.] It may not exist yet; creating it is an operator step.
4. With Feishu: **which chats,** by name? The agent looks up their ids after the bot is configured.

**Policy: who may ask for work.**

5. **On GitHub.** Which GitHub logins may ask the agent for work? [Only `<operator login>`: the agent acts only for people on this list, and a short list keeps the team's noise low while the operator learns how the agent behaves.]
6. With Feishu: **who may ask in Feishu?** [Everyone in the first chat, kept in sync with its members.]

**Execution: what the agent does with a Ticket.**

7. **Checkout.** Which local clone of the repository should each Ticket check out from? [A new clone under `~/src/<name>`.]
8. **Commit identity.** Who should the agent's commits name as author? [The agent account, so its work is visibly its own.] Another identity, such as the operator's, goes into the Delivery requirements prompt section.
9. **Auto-merge.** Should the agent enable auto-merge on its own pull requests once they are ready and approved? [No: people merge until the agent's pull requests have been right for a while.] The agent never enables it as the agent account, so with yes it needs the GitHub CLI of another account that may merge: ask the operator to sign one in among the operator steps, and name it in Delivery requirements. With no, remove the auto-merge paragraph from Delivery requirements.

Do not ask about values with a good default; list them in the plan instead:

- profile `superagent`, a copy of DSH's Web profile kept apart from the profile the operator works in, so it restarts without closing their Sessions; port `3082`; state directory `<home>/.dsh/state/superagent` as an absolute path;
- an hourly check from the operator's own profile, which repairs dsh-superagent when it is not running;
- branch prefix `agent/`;
- accept mode `observe`, which records proactive work without doing it, and the default rules and prompt sections;
- with Feishu: the bot reads only mentions, and direct messages are on.

## 3. Plan

Send one message, under 300 words: what will be installed, the accounts and CLIs, the settings to save, the operator steps, and the defaults. Ask for one confirmation.

## 4. Execute

1. **Operator steps first.** Read the Accounts section of `docs/006-deployment.md`, write the CLI wrappers yourself, then send one message with what only the operator can do: create the agent account and, with auto-merge, sign a CLI in as the account that enables it, accept the repository invitation as the agent account, run `auth login` for each wrapper, adding `-s repo,notifications` for the agent wrapper, and for Feishu create and publish the bot app and run the `config init` command with its secret. Wait until the operator says it is done, then check each login with `<wrapper> api user --jq .login` and the agent wrapper's token scopes with `<wrapper> auth status`.
2. **Install and start.** Follow the Install, Machine configuration, and Start and stop sections of `docs/006-deployment.md`. Skip the `git clone` of this repository: you are in its checkout. Clone the repository of question 2 if question 7 asked for a new clone. With an existing profile, skip the `dsh superagent --from-default-profile` command, which would replace the profile and delete its `cordis.patch.yml`, and edit that file instead of replacing it.
3. **Settings.** Save them through the Management API of `docs/006-deployment.md`, in this order: the `github` Source, the `feishu` Source if used, the `policy` block with the allowed lists (for Feishu, look up the chat ids with the bot's CLI first), and the `executor` block with a prepare command from the answer to question 7. Then save the prompts with the commit identity of question 8 and the auto-merge answer of question 9 in Delivery requirements. A save that returns `restarting: true` restarts dsh-superagent: wait until `scripts/dsh-superagent status` no longer exits 1 before the next request, and read the revisions again from `GET settings`.
4. **Failures.** A refused save names the setup problem in its response body. Find it in the Troubleshooting table of `docs/006-deployment.md`, fix it, and continue. Ask the operator only for what you cannot fix yourself.

## 5. Verify and hand over

`scripts/dsh-superagent status` exits 0 with no setup problem. If you run in the operator's own DSH profile, create the hourly check of the Hourly check section of `docs/006-deployment.md` with your schedule tool; otherwise give the operator its prompt to schedule there. Then send one message, under 300 words:

- The panel URL, and that the **Superagent** entry in the sidebar is where to look.
- How to try it: from an account on the allowed list, comment `@<agent login> <request>` on an issue in the repository. A Ticket appears on the overview within about a minute.
- Three rules for the operator, from the Responsibility section of `docs/000-philosophy.md`: start narrow, tune for less noise, own what the agent says.
- Where to read more: the numbered documents in `docs/`, in order.
